>"Design is my muse. Code is my medium"

I am a UX/UI Engineer who specializes in the craft of design implementation. For every project,  my goal is to  bridge the gap between design and engineering and ensure that what ends up in the hands of users is a faithful representation of the design vision.


With experience in both design and front-end development, I bring an engineer’s pattern thinking to systematizing designs with a designer’s eye for polish, and empathy for a user’s needs.


Currently, I live in beautiful Seattle, WA and work as a UI engineer at <a href="https://indigoslate.com/" target="_blank">Indigo Slate</a> where I work on awesome projects with insanely creative people.


This portfolio is a collection of my most recent professional work. I also write about front-end development <a href="/" target="_blank">here</a>.
