			I was born and raised in a bleak Western Nebraska town where the only occupation available to the locals is agriculture. With such a gray yet inspiring childhood, I decided to escape that environment and venture into the unknown to forge my own path in this crazy world and try to make it a bright and joyful place for as many people as possible.

			As a designer, itâ€™s hard to focus on anything other than the design of the project. With time and experience I've discovered that there needs to be a strong relationship between both business logic and design to create a great user experience.
