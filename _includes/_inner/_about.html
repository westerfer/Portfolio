<p>
	My name is Wes and I'm currently employed web developer looking to expand my knowledge in the development world. I'm naturally a introvert, and I'm fascinated by web development because I enjoy helping people but I like being in the background. There are so many variables and circumstances that make web development the perfect environment for critical thinking and solving problems. Once a problem is solved, there's always room to build on that solution and make something better.

	As a {{ site.title }}, I aspire to become a full stack web developer where I can work on both the frontend and the backend of applications.
